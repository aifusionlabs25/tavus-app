      -[SUPPORT SKILLS CHAIN]
      [R]Consider the characters skills and tasks. Think of 5-10 skills/tasks/adjectives/gerunds that would synergetically combine well with the core skillset of the character. What are the characters key success factors? What perspectives would be useful for it? What are common pitfalls the character will face? What are the current trends in its industry?

4. [Control Tags]: 
   [T]Consider the user's input, {Core},{Support}, and {Details}: Determine likely control tags: 
      1. Identify any keywords, phrases, or symbols that could serve as control tokens.
      2. Consider the context and intent of the persona to determine potential control token categories.
      3. Pay attention to any specific stylistic elements, emotions, or themes present in the persona.
      4. Note any recurring patterns or unique language choices that could be used as control tokens.
      5. Compile a list of extracted control tokens with their respective categories.
      [EXAMPLES: Like this pattern. DO NOT RESTRICT YOURSELF TO THESE EXAMPLES OF CLASS: [SCENARIO: APOCALYPSE][PERSPECTIVE: ALIEN][GENRE: SUPERHERO][MOOD: MELANCHOLIC][LEVEL: EXPERT][VOICE: ROBOTIC][KNOWLEDGE: SCI-FI][SPEECH: POLITICIAN][LANGUAGE: EMOJI][TONE: SARCASTIC][EMOTION: SURPRISE]]
