TITLE: Competitive Battle Cards (Safe Use Version)

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Help Morgan speak credibly about other field service solutions.
- Stay respectful and customer-centric.
- Emphasize fit, value, and time-to-value instead of trashing competitors.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Never insult or disparage a competitor.
- Treat all competitor info as approximate and based on public info + customer feedback.
- Use phrases like “we often hear…”, “customers tell us…”, “in our experience…”.
- Avoid specific claims about competitor pricing, churn, or market share as hard facts.
- If a prospect asks for exact competitor pricing or terms, Morgan should say:
  “I can share what we typically hear from customers, but exact pricing and terms will always come directly from that vendor.”

HOW MORGAN SHOULD USE THIS FILE:
1. FIRST:
   - Clarify who the prospect is using or evaluating: “Are you currently on a field service platform like ServiceTitan, Jobber, Housecall Pro, FieldEdge, or something homegrown?”
2. SECOND:
   - Ask 1–2 questions about their experience: “What do you like about it?” / “What’s frustrating?”
3. THIRD:
   - Pick ONE short positioning summary and, if needed, ONE example story. Do NOT read long scripts.
4. FOURTH:
   - Bridge back to goDeskless: how it might be a better fit for their situation.

NOTE:
- For deeper messaging philosophy, see `KB_Competition_Intel_Positioning_v2.txt`.
- For pricing ranges, see `KB_Pricing_Scenarios_Examples_v2.txt` (still use “ballpark” language).

-----------------------------------
SECTION: ServiceTitan

CUSTOMER-LEVEL POSITIONING (high level):
- Good fit:
  - Very large, complex field service operations
  - Heavy back-office workflows and deep configuration needs
  - Teams with strong in-house IT and appetite for big deployments
- Common friction we hear:
  - High total cost of ownership
  - Long implementations and change-management efforts
  - Feels like “more than we need” for some mid-market teams

DISCOVERY HOOKS (pick 1–2):
- “Roughly how many field techs do you have, and how complex are your workflows?”
- “How did your implementation and rollout timeline go with ServiceTitan?”
- “Do you feel you’re using 80–90% of what you’re paying for, or more like 20–30%?”

GO-DESKLESS POSITIONING (light, respectful):
- “Where ServiceTitan shines is in very large, complex environments with big IT support.
   goDeskless is designed to give you:
   - AI-assisted dispatch and scheduling
   - A simpler, mobile-first tech experience
   - Faster time-to-value, especially for teams that don’t want a year-long project.”

EXAMPLE TALK TRACK (condensed):
- “Many teams we meet chose ServiceTitan when they were smaller, then realized later
   that it was built for a much bigger, more complex environment than they really are.
   They tell us things like ‘We use a fraction of it, but pay for all of it,’ and
   implementation or change requests can be heavy.
   goDeskless is positioned more as a modern, AI-first field service platform with
   a shorter path to value and a lighter change-management lift.
   If you’re feeling that mismatch, it’s worth exploring whether goDeskless is a better fit.”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: Jobber

CUSTOMER-LEVEL POSITIONING:
- Good fit:
  - Very small shops, solo operators, or early-stage teams
  - Basic quoting + scheduling + invoicing
- Common friction we hear:
  - Outgrowing its capabilities as the team scales
  - Challenges coordinating multiple crews and complex jobs
  - Limited visibility and workflows for dispatchers / managers

DISCOVERY HOOKS:
- “How many techs or crews are you running today?”
- “Do you have someone whose job is primarily dispatch and coordination?”
- “Is Jobber still handling your complexity smoothly, or are you bumping into workarounds?”

GO-DESKLESS POSITIONING:
- “Jobber is great when you’re just getting started.
   goDeskless is built for the moment when:
   - You’re juggling multiple crews and routes
   - You need better visibility from office to field
   - You want AI to help optimize routes, schedules, and technician productivity.”

EXAMPLE TALK TRACK:
- “A lot of teams we talk to started on Jobber and loved it in the early days.
   Then they hit a point where they were managing multiple crews, routes, and SLAs,
   and Jobber felt more like a starter tool than an operating system.
   goDeskless is designed for that ‘scale-up’ moment—keeping things simple for techs,
   while giving dispatchers and managers the visibility and optimization they’ve been missing.”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: Housecall Pro

CUSTOMER-LEVEL POSITIONING:
- Good fit:
  - Residential service contractors
  - Tight combination of scheduling, estimates, and payments
- Common friction we hear:
  - Limited flexibility for more complex commercial / multi-site work
  - Reporting and analytics limits as teams grow
  - Desire for deeper field visibility and AI-driven insights

DISCOVERY HOOKS:
- “Are you mostly doing residential work, or do you also handle commercial/multi-site contracts?”
- “How happy are you with the visibility you have into jobs in progress?”
- “Do you feel you have the analytics you need to manage at scale?”

GO-DESKLESS POSITIONING:
- “Housecall Pro is a solid fit for residential-heavy work.
   goDeskless leans into:
   - Real-time field visibility
   - AI-powered dispatch and prioritization
   - A more scalable backbone for mixed residential/commercial teams.”

EXAMPLE TALK TRACK:
- “Teams who move from Housecall Pro to goDeskless often tell us:
   ‘We needed something built for more complex operations.’
   They want better visibility into what’s happening now, tools that scale with
   larger contracts, and more AI-driven decision support.”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: Homegrown / Spreadsheet / “Frankenstack”

CUSTOMER-LEVEL POSITIONING:
- Typical setup:
  - Google Sheets, Excel, email, text groups, whiteboards
  - Maybe a light CRM + separate scheduling tools
- Common friction we hear:
  - Dependence on a few ‘heroes’ who know how it all works
  - Lots of manual data entry and copy/paste
  - Limited visibility and reporting

DISCOVERY HOOKS:
- “How many different tools do you have to touch to get a job from request to invoice?”
- “If your main coordinator left tomorrow, what’s the risk to your operation?”
- “Do you feel your current setup could handle 2x the volume?”

GO-DESKLESS POSITIONING:
- “Homegrown systems can be powerful, but they depend heavily on a few people.
   goDeskless aims to:
   - Put everything into a single, field-first platform
   - Reduce the manual glue-work
   - Give you an upgrade path without breaking what already works.”

EXAMPLE TALK TRACK:
- “We see a lot of teams running impressive operations on spreadsheets and duct tape.
   The downside is that growth gets scary, and risk concentrates in a few people’s heads.
   goDeskless gives you a way to formalize what’s working, automate what’s repetitive,
   and build a platform that can handle more volume without burning people out.”

-----------------------------------
ENDING GUIDANCE:
- Use this file to:
  - Acknowledge what the customer likes about their current tool.
  - Highlight where goDeskless is simply a better fit for their situation.
  - Offer to explore a focused demo: “Based on what you’ve told me, here’s the part of goDeskless I’d show first…”
- If the customer wants deep competitive detail or specific price matching:
  - Morgan should say:
    “I can give you high-level patterns and what we hear from customers, but exact pricing and roadmap details would come from our sales team.”
