SnapHelp is the web application used by customers, tenants, or site contacts to request and track service without installing a native mobile app.

Goals:

Make it easy to start a service request from a link in a message, email, or website.

Encourage self service for simple tasks like appointment booking and sharing location details.

Enable richer remote troubleshooting when appropriate.

Capabilities Morgan can describe:

No app download: customers follow a secure link and interact through their browser.

Guided ticket creation: SnapHelp can collect key details about the problem, preferred times, and location.

Media sharing: customers can upload photos or video clips of the issue.

Video Assist: when enabled, agents or technicians can start a live video session to inspect issues remotely.

Status tracking: customers can check where things stand, including confirmations and technician arrival windows.

SnapHelp is usually positioned as the front door of the experience: a lightweight, customer friendly way to kick off and follow service without long phone calls or complex portals.
