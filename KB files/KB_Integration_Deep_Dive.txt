TITLE: Integration Deep Dive

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Help Morgan answer “Do you integrate with X?” in a concise, confident way.
- Provide high-level clarity first, then optional deeper detail.
- Avoid over-promising specifics about timelines, packaging, or custom work.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Treat all integration details as “typical” or “common” – not guarantees.
- Use language like “usually”, “often”, “typical pattern”, “ballpark”.
- For anything custom or complex, Morgan should offer to involve the solutions/IT team.

-----------------------------------
HOW MORGAN SHOULD USE THIS FILE

WHEN A USER ASKS:
- “Do you integrate with Salesforce/HubSpot/QuickBooks/etc.?”
  1. Respond with a short, confident YES/NO + brief explanation.
  2. Ask 1–2 clarifying questions.
  3. Only then, offer deeper detail if they’re interested.

GENERIC ANSWER PATTERN (SHORT VERSION):

“Yes, we integrate with [SYSTEM]. In most cases we:
- Sync [high-level objects: e.g., customers, jobs, invoices]
- Keep [directionality: one-way / two-way] data consistent, and
- Let you manage field operations in goDeskless while keeping [SYSTEM] as your system of record.

The exact setup depends on your workflows, but most teams are up and running in roughly [ballpark time]. For anything complex or custom, we’d pull in our solutions team.”

MORGAN SHOULD:
- Avoid specifying exact hours or days unless the user pushes.
- Avoid promising “out-of-the-box” for niche systems.
- Offer to log an integration interest note for follow-up.

-----------------------------------
SECTION: Salesforce

SHORT ANSWER SUMMARY:
- “Yes, we integrate with Salesforce. The common pattern is:
   - Salesforce stays your CRM / system of record.
   - goDeskless manages field operations and jobs.
   - We sync accounts/contacts and job-related data so sales and ops stay aligned.”

CLARIFYING QUESTIONS (pick 1–2):
- “Which Salesforce clouds are you using today? (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Field Service, etc.)”
- “Do you want Salesforce to drive job creation, or should jobs originate in goDeskless?”
- “Who mainly uses Salesforce now – sales, service, or a mix?”

TYPICAL INTEGRATION PATTERN:
- Data synced:
  - Accounts / Contacts ↔ Customers
  - Opportunities / Cases → Jobs / Work Orders
  - Status + key job outcomes → back to Salesforce for reporting
- Direction:
  - Usually one-way or bi-directional depending on use case.
- Typical timeline:
  - Simple sync patterns: days to a couple of weeks.
  - Complex, custom objects / automations: longer, needs solutions design.

ESCALATION PHRASE:
- “For detailed field mappings and custom objects, we’d have our solutions team design it with you—I can note that as a follow-up.”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: HubSpot

SHORT ANSWER SUMMARY:
- “Yes, we commonly integrate with HubSpot as the marketing/sales front-end and use goDeskless for actual field work and service delivery.”

CLARIFYING QUESTIONS:
- “Are you mostly using HubSpot for marketing, sales, service, or all three?”
- “Do you want service tickets in HubSpot to turn into jobs in goDeskless automatically?”

TYPICAL INTEGRATION PATTERN:
- Contacts / Companies ↔ Customers
- Deals / Tickets → Jobs
- Key job outcomes (completed, scheduled, missed, etc.) → HubSpot for lifecycle tracking

NOTES:
- Emphasize that exact behavior is configurable.
- Avoid quoting specific setup hours; say “usually fairly quick once we agree on the mapping.”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: QuickBooks / Xero

SHORT ANSWER SUMMARY:
- “Yes, we integrate with accounting systems like QuickBooks and Xero. The typical model is:
   - goDeskless handles scheduling, work orders, and job completion.
   - We send the right info back to accounting for invoicing and financial reporting.”

CLARIFYING QUESTIONS:
- “Do you currently invoice from QuickBooks/Xero directly, or from another system?”
- “Is your goal to automate invoice creation once jobs are completed?”

TYPICAL INTEGRATION PATTERN:
- Jobs / Work orders → Invoices (or invoice line items)
- Customer records alignment between systems
- Option to push payments/reconciliation info back to goDeskless for status

GUARDRAIL:
- Morgan should NOT:
  - Promise specific tax logic or region-specific accounting rules.
  - Claim coverage for every edition of accounting software.
- Instead:
  - “We cover the most common flows; for anything advanced, we’d design it with your finance/IT team.”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: Email, Calendar, & Communication Tools

SHORT ANSWER SUMMARY:
- “We can integrate with email and calendar tools so dispatchers and techs don’t live in a separate universe from everyone else.”

TYPICAL EXAMPLES:
- Outbound notifications via email/SMS to customers
- Calendar sync for technician schedules (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365)

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
- “Are your teams primarily on Google Workspace or Microsoft 365?”
- “Do you want customers to get automated appointment confirmations or reminders?”

-----------------------------------
SECTION: “Other Tools” / Homegrown Systems

SHORT ANSWER SUMMARY:
- “We integrate with a lot of systems—both off-the-shelf and homegrown. The key is:
   - What data needs to move?
   - How often?
   - In which direction?”

MORGAN’S PATTERN:
- Ask:
  - “What system is it?”
  - “What kind of data needs to be shared?”
- Then say:
  - “That’s likely doable, but it’ll need a quick architecture review. I can flag this for our team to confirm.”

-----------------------------------
FINAL GUIDANCE

WHEN TO GO DEEP:
- The user explicitly says:
  - “I’m technical; tell me how it works,” or
  - “Integration is the make-or-break for us.”

WHEN TO KEEP IT HIGH-LEVEL:
- Early discovery
- Non-technical stakeholders
- Executive-level conversations

DEFAULT ESCALATION:
- “For a serious implementation, we’d involve our solutions team to design the integration with you. I can capture your systems and goals so they’re ready for that conversation.”
