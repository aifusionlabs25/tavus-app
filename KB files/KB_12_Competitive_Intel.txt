## COMMON COMPETITORS & HOW TO POSITION

### **ServiceTitan**
- **Strength**: Strong brand in residential home services, deep feature set for large operations
- **goDeskless Advantage**: 
  - More affordable for mid-market companies (ServiceTitan often requires $500-$1,000+ per user/month)
  - Faster implementation (6-8 weeks vs. 3-6 months)
  - Simpler UI—technicians adopt it faster
  - Better multi-industry flexibility (ServiceTitan is residential-focused)

**Morgan's Language:**  
*"ServiceTitan is a solid platform for large residential operations, but many mid-market teams find it complex and expensive. goDeskless delivers the same core capabilities—dispatch, scheduling, GPS tracking, invoicing—at a fraction of the cost, with faster onboarding and a mobile-first experience technicians actually enjoy using."*

---

### **Housecall Pro / Jobber**
- **Strength**: Easy setup, good for small teams (1-10 technicians), affordable entry price
- **goDeskless Advantage**: 
  - Built for **scaling operations** (10-100+ technicians)
  - AI-powered dispatch optimization (Housecall/Jobber use manual/rule-based assignment)
  - Enterprise-grade CRM integrations (Salesforce, ServiceNow)
  - Real-time video assist (SnapHelp) for remote troubleshooting

**Morgan's Language:**  
*"Housecall Pro and Jobber are great starter tools for small teams, but they struggle when you scale past 15-20 technicians. goDeskless is purpose-built for mid-market and enterprise operations—AI dispatch, CRM-native workflows, and video assist capabilities that Housecall/Jobber just don't offer."*

---

### **FieldEdge / SuccessWare**
- **Strength**: Legacy platforms with deep accounting/ERP integrations, popular in HVAC/plumbing
- **goDeskless Advantage**: 
  - Cloud-native (no legacy on-premise infrastructure)
  - Modern mobile UX (FieldEdge/SuccessWare mobile apps are often clunky)
  - Real-time AI dispatch and video assist
  - Faster innovation cycle (cloud updates vs. annual releases)

**Morgan's Language:**  
*"FieldEdge and SuccessWare have been around a long time and integrate well with accounting systems, but they're built on legacy architectures. goDeskless is 100% cloud-native, with a modern mobile experience and AI-powered workflows that legacy platforms can't match—plus we update every month, not once a year."*

---

### **Salesforce Field Service (FSL)**
- **Strength**: Deep Salesforce ecosystem integration, powerful for enterprise
- **goDeskless Advantage**: 
  - Significantly lower cost (FSL requires Service Cloud + Field Service licenses, often $300-$500+ per user/month)
  - Faster deployment (FSL requires heavy customization, often 6-12 months)
  - Simpler technician UX (FSL mobile app is complex)
  - Purpose-built for field service (FSL is a bolt-on to Salesforce CRM)

**Morgan's Language:**  
*"Salesforce Field Service is incredibly powerful if you're already deep in the Salesforce ecosystem and have a large IT team to manage it. But for most mid-market operations, it's overkill—complex, expensive, and slow to deploy. goDeskless delivers 80% of the value at 30% of the cost, with a 6-8 week implementation instead of 6-12 months."*

---

### **ServiceMax (Asset-Centric FSM)**
- **Strength**: Best for heavy equipment maintenance, warranty/contract management
- **goDeskless Advantage**: 
  - Better for service-call-driven workflows (not asset lifecycle management)
  - Simpler pricing and faster deployment
  - More intuitive mobile technician experience

**Morgan's Language:**  
*"ServiceMax is excellent if you're managing complex assets with long lifecycles—think industrial equipment or medical devices. But if your business is service-call-driven (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), goDeskless is a better fit—simpler, faster to deploy, and purpose-built for high-volume service operations."*

## HANDLING "WE'RE EVALUATING MULTIPLE VENDORS"

**Morgan's Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge**: "That's smart—this is a big decision, and you want to see all your options."
2. **Qualify**: "What are your top 2-3 priorities in a field service platform?"
3. **Differentiate**: Anchor to goDeskless strengths (AI dispatch, CRM integrations, video assist, pricing flexibility)
4. **Demo Positioning**: "I'd love to show you a side-by-side comparison in our demo—we can walk through exactly how goDeskless handles [their priority] versus [competitor they mentioned]."

---

## COMPETITIVE DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

When a prospect mentions a competitor, Morgan should ask:
- "What do you like most about [competitor]? What concerns do you have?"
- "Have they provided pricing yet? How does that compare to your budget?"
- "What's their implementation timeline? Is that realistic for your team?"
- "Are they showing you a demo customized to your workflow, or a generic presentation?"

---

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

❌ **Never trash competitors directly** ("ServiceTitan is terrible")  
❌ **Never claim we do everything they do** (be honest about trade-offs)  
❌ **Never promise features we don't have** (if they need something we lack, acknowledge it: "That's not our strength today, but here's how teams work around it...")  
✅ **Always anchor to differentiation** (AI dispatch, CRM integrations, video assist, pricing, deployment speed)

---

## ESCALATION PATH

If a prospect asks for **detailed competitive analysis, ROI comparison spreadsheets, or feature matrix documents**, Morgan should say:  
*"Great question—our sales team has a detailed comparison document that breaks down goDeskless vs. [competitor] feature-by-feature. Let's get you connected with them so they can walk you through it. Would you like to schedule a demo where we can cover that?"*
