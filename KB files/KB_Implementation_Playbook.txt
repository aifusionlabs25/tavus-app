TITLE: Implementation Playbook

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Help Morgan confidently answer “What does implementation look like?” and “How long will this take?”
- Provide realistic ranges and a sense of structure, without overpromising exact timelines.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- All timelines are typical ranges, NOT guarantees.
- Morgan should use words like “usually”, “often”, “typical”, “for most teams like yours”.
- For complex environments, Morgan should say “We’d confirm this with your team in a proper implementation plan.”

-----------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY (short answer)

If someone asks:
“How long does implementation actually take?”

Morgan should say something like:

“For most teams, go-live is roughly 4–6 weeks from project kickoff.
If data is clean and we keep scope tight, some teams fast-track in 2–3 weeks.
The exact timing depends on:
- how complex your current tools are,
- how quickly we can get data and decisions from your side,
- and how many integrations we turn on in phase one.”

Then follow with:
“High-level, we usually go through:
1) data & process intake,
2) configuration & testing,
3) training for dispatchers and techs,
4) go-live and early optimization.”

-----------------------------------
STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION (4–6 weeks)

PHASE 1: Discovery & Design (Week 1–2)
- Goals:
  - Understand current tools, workflows, and data quality.
  - Align on scope for “phase one” vs. “later”.
- Typical activities:
  - Project kickoff with key stakeholders.
  - Walkthrough of current dispatch, field workflows, and reporting.
  - Data sample review (customers, assets, jobs).
- Morgan’s summary phrase:
  - “First couple of weeks: we align on how you work today and decide what ‘good’ looks like in goDeskless.”

PHASE 2: Configuration & Data Prep (Week 2–3)
- Goals:
  - Configure environments, basic workflows, and any core integrations.
  - Prepare imports for foundational data.
- Typical activities:
  - Set up users, roles, and permissions.
  - Configure key workflows (job types, statuses, checklists).
  - Test core integrations (e.g., CRM or accounting system) with sample records.
- Morgan’s summary phrase:
  - “We set up the core pieces: who’s in the system, how jobs flow, and how data syncs.”

PHASE 3: Pilot & Training (Week 3–4)
- Goals:
  - Train dispatchers/coordinators and a first wave of field techs.
  - Pilot on a subset of jobs.
- Typical activities:
  - Hands-on sessions for office staff.
  - Short training modules or ride-alongs for field techs.
  - Capture feedback and adjust configurations.
- Morgan’s summary phrase:
  - “We run a pilot with a slice of your real work, train your team, and smooth out rough edges before going all-in.”

PHASE 4: Go-Live & Optimization (Week 4–6)
- Goals:
  - Turn on the system for broader use.
  - Monitor adoption and identify quick wins.
- Typical activities:
  - Official “go-live” date.
  - Support hours or check-ins during the first couple of weeks.
  - Tuning alerts, reports, and dashboards based on real usage.
- Morgan’s summary phrase:
  - “We turn the system on for everyone, then watch closely and tune things as your team uses it.”

-----------------------------------
FAST-TRACK IMPLEMENTATION (2–3 weeks)

USE WHEN:
- Data is relatively clean.
- Customer is okay starting with a simpler initial scope.
- The team is motivated and available.

Morgan can say:

“If you’re ready to move quickly and keep phase one focused, we can often fast-track into a 2–3 week path:
- Week 1: discovery + initial setup
- Week 2: training + pilot
- Week 3: go-live + early tuning”

Always add:
“We’d confirm whether fast-track is realistic for you once we see your data and workflows.”

-----------------------------------
SPECIAL CASES (Larger / Complex / Regulated)

If a prospect:
- Has multiple business units or regions
- Has heavy regulatory or compliance requirements
- Needs complex integrations

Morgan should say:

“For more complex environments—multiple regions, regulated industries, or many systems—we typically phase the rollout:
- Phase 1: one region or business unit,
- Then expand once we know the pattern works.

Those projects can still move quickly, but we’d formalize a project plan with your team.”

-----------------------------------
INTERACTION GUIDELINES FOR MORGAN

DO:
- Start with the high-level 4–6 week answer.
- Ask:
  - “Do you consider your environment simple, moderate, or complex?”
  - “Do you have internal IT or would you lean on us more heavily?”
- Tailor the answer accordingly.

DON’T:
- Promise exact dates.
- Commit to fast-track without conditions.
- Guarantee outcomes without human involvement.

DEFAULT ESCALATION LINE:
- “If implementation is a make-or-break question for you, the next step would be to do a short implementation scoping call with our team so we can give you a more specific plan.”
