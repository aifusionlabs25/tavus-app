TITLE: Customer Success Stories (Representative Examples)

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Give Morgan short, punchy stories that show what success can look like.
- Keep examples “representative” rather than precise claims.
- Enable Morgan to quickly match a story to a prospect’s profile.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Treat these as composite, representative examples based on patterns from similar customers.
- Morgan should say things like:
  - “For example, a customer like you…”
  - “A team similar to yours saw…”
- Avoid presenting any single story as an exact, named case unless you have explicit marketing approval.

HOW MORGAN SHOULD USE THIS FILE:
1. Identify what the prospect looks like:
   - Size (small / mid / large), industry, main pain.
2. Pick ONE relevant story.
3. Summarize in 2–3 sentences.
4. Offer to send a more detailed write-up via email instead of reading long details on the call.

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1: Mid-Sized HVAC Team – Revenue Capture & Capacity

PROFILE:
- Location: Sunbelt metro area
- Size: ~25–30 field technicians
- Industry: HVAC + light plumbing
- Main pains:
  - Missed jobs during peak season
  - Dispatch juggling without visibility
  - Lost follow-up opportunities

BEFORE:
- Running on:
  - A patchwork of scheduling tools and spreadsheets
  - Manual dispatch and phone calls
- Symptoms:
  - Jobs falling through the cracks in busy season
  - Technicians idling while others were overloaded
  - Difficulty predicting capacity and revenue

AFTER GOESKLESS:
- Consolidated scheduling and dispatch into goDeskless.
- Gained real-time visibility of technician location and workload.
- Used AI-assisted dispatch to balance routes and teams.

REPRESENTATIVE OUTCOMES (approximate):
- Captured a meaningful chunk of previously lost peak-season work.
- Increased jobs completed per day per tech.
- Improved on-time arrival rates and customer satisfaction scores.

MORGAN’S SHORT VERSION:
- “A mid-sized HVAC team with around 25 techs went from spreadsheets and manual dispatch
   to using goDeskless as their central field platform.
   During peak season, they were able to capture significantly more jobs and keep techs better utilized,
   instead of watching work slip through the cracks.”

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 2: Regional Plumbing Company – Truck Rolls & First-Time Fix

PROFILE:
- Size: ~15–20 techs
- Industry: Plumbing + drain cleaning
- Main pains:
  - High number of repeat visits (no first-time fix)
  - Unclear job notes and history for techs in the field
  - Extra truck rolls eating into margins

BEFORE:
- Techs arriving onsite without full job context.
- Inconsistent documentation between visits.
- Dispatchers guessing who to send where.

AFTER GOESKLESS:
- Structured job notes and checklists in the field app.
- Asset/service history available to techs on arrival.
- Better matching of tech skills to job types.

REPRESENTATIVE OUTCOMES:
- Fewer follow-up visits for simple jobs.
- Improved technician productivity and morale.
- Reduced unnecessary truck rolls and fuel waste.

MORGAN’S SHORT VERSION:
- “A regional plumbing company with ~15–20 techs used goDeskless to give techs better job context and structured checklists.
   Over time, they saw fewer repeat visits on simple jobs and cut down on unnecessary truck rolls,
   which directly improved margins.”

-----------------------------------
EXAMPLE 3: Multi-Region Service Provider – Visibility & Reporting

PROFILE:
- Size: 80+ technicians across multiple regions
- Industry: Mixed commercial/residential field service
- Main pains:
  - Leaders couldn’t see what was happening in the field in real time.
  - Weekly reporting took hours of manual work.
  - Difficult to compare region-to-region performance.

BEFORE:
- Patchwork of systems per region.
- Reporting via spreadsheets and manual exports.
- No single view of technician utilization or job status.

AFTER GOESKLESS:
- Standardized dispatch and field workflows across regions.
- Centralized dashboards for jobs, SLAs, and technician utilization.
- Leadership could see performance by region at a glance.

REPRESENTATIVE OUTCOMES:
- Less time spent building reports.
- Faster identification of underperforming regions/routes.
- Clearer decisions about staffing and resource allocation.

MORGAN’S SHORT VERSION:
- “A multi-region service provider rolled out goDeskless as a common platform across locations.
   Instead of stitching together spreadsheets every week, leadership now has real-time dashboards
   showing job status and technician utilization by region, which helps them make faster, better decisions.”

CLOSING GUIDANCE FOR MORGAN

WHEN TO USE STORIES:
- When a prospect says:
  - “Has anyone like us done this?”
  - “What kind of results do people actually see?”
- Keep it short, then offer:
  - “If you’d like, I can have our team send a deeper case study after this call.”

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Naming specific companies or logos unless you are sure they’re approved references.
- Quoting very precise ROI numbers as promises.
- Suggesting that these outcomes are guaranteed; always frame as “examples” or “typical patterns.”
