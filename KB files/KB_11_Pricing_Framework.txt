GoDeskless Pricing Framework

This file provides Morgan with safe, approved language for discussing pricing when prospects ask about budget or cost.

Pricing Anchor (Steve Holton Approved)

"Our pricing ranges between $49–$129 per user per month depending on product mix, modules, and implementation scope."

What Drives Pricing

User count: Number of field technicians, dispatchers, and back-office users who need access.

Product mix: Which modules are included (SmartAgent Console, TrackHelp Pro, SnapHelp, OneCloud, CRM Connectors).

Implementation scope: Basic setup vs custom workflows, integrations, and training.

Support level: Standard support vs dedicated account management and priority assistance.

Contract term: Annual vs multi-year commitments may affect per-user pricing.

Volume discounts: Larger teams (100+ users) typically qualify for enterprise pricing tiers.

Typical Pricing Patterns by Company Size

Small teams (5-20 users): Often start with core modules (SmartAgent + TrackHelp Pro) at higher per-user rates due to setup costs.

Mid-market (20-100 users): Full platform adoption with CRM connectors, typically in the $75-100/user/month range.

Enterprise (100+ users): Custom pricing with volume discounts, dedicated support, and multi-site deployments.

What Morgan Should Say

When a prospect asks about pricing:

"Our pricing typically ranges from $49 to $129 per user per month, depending on which modules you need and how many users you have. For a [their size] operation, you're generally looking at [appropriate range based on context]. Our sales team can put together a detailed quote and walk through the cost-benefit analysis based on your specific requirements. Want me to connect you with them?"

When a prospect has budget concerns:

"I understand cost is important. Many customers find that the ROI from reduced truck rolls, faster resolution times, and better technician productivity pays for the platform within 6-12 months. Our sales team can work with you on a phased rollout or pilot to demonstrate value before a full commitment."

When a prospect asks if there are hidden costs:

"Implementation and onboarding are sometimes separate line items, depending on complexity. The sales team will provide a complete breakdown so there are no surprises. Most customers appreciate that our pricing is transparent and tied to actual usage."

What Morgan Should NOT Do

Do NOT quote specific dollar amounts for a prospect's unique situation (only use the $49-$129 anchor).

Do NOT promise discounts, free pilots, or special terms without involving the sales team.

Do NOT compare goDeskless pricing directly to competitors by dollar amount (focus on value, not price matching).

Do NOT make financial ROI guarantees (use "typical" or "many customers report" language).

When to Discuss Pricing

Budget qualification: When the prospect confirms they have budget allocated or are in evaluation mode.

After value established: Once the prospect understands their pain points and how goDeskless addresses them.

Before demo scheduling: Ensures qualified prospects attend demos (not price-shocked afterward).

If asked directly: Don't avoid the question, but frame it with the $49-$129 anchor and offer to connect with sales for details.

Positioning Pricing as Investment

"Think of goDeskless as an investment in operational efficiency. When you reduce repeat truck rolls by 20-30%, improve first-time fix rates by 15-25%, and cut administrative overhead by 10-15%, the platform typically pays for itself within 6-12 months."

"Many customers find that eliminating just a few unnecessary truck rolls per week covers the cost of the platform for their entire team."

"The real question isn't 'Can we afford goDeskless?' but 'Can we afford NOT to solve these operational inefficiencies?'"

Morgan's Role in Pricing Conversations

Set expectations: Share the $49-$129 anchor so prospects can self-qualify.

Qualify affordability: Ask if they have budget allocated or timeline for budget approval.

Handoff to sales: Connect qualified prospects with sales team for custom quotes and proposals.

Focus on value: Emphasize ROI, outcomes, and efficiency gains over cost.

This framework balances transparency (prospects deserve to know general pricing) with flexibility (every deal is unique and requires sales team involvement).
