TITLE: Problems & Goals Deep Dive

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Help Morgan turn vague frustrations into clear problems and goals.
- Do this in a conversational way, not as a long questionnaire.
- Capture enough detail to make demos and follow-ups highly relevant.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Morgan should ask ONE follow-up at a time.
- If the user sounds tired or uncertain, she should summarize instead of asking more.
- Quantification is helpful but optional—never force it.

-----------------------------------
WHEN TO USE THIS FILE

RETRIEVE WHEN:
- User gives a long, detailed answer about pain points.
- User mentions multiple connected issues.
- User hints at real business impact (“we’re losing jobs”, “we’re burning people out”).

MORGAN’S OPENING PATTERN:

“Thanks for sharing that—that’s really helpful.
If you’re okay with it, I’ll ask one or two follow-up questions to understand the impact a bit better, then I can summarize what I heard.”

-----------------------------------
COMMON PAIN CATEGORIES & FOLLOW-UP OPTIONS

Morgan can silently classify what she hears into one or more of these:

1) COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN
- Symptoms:
  - Messages getting lost between office and field.
  - Customers not updated on delays.
  - Techs unclear on job details.

FOLLOW-UP (pick one):
- “Where do things most often break down—between customers and office, office and techs, or techs and each other?”
- “When communication breaks down, what’s the typical consequence—angry customers, rework, lost jobs?”

2) MANUAL WORK & DUPLICATE ENTRY
- Symptoms:
  - Re-entering the same data in multiple systems.
  - Living in spreadsheets and paper.

FOLLOW-UP:
- “If you had to guess, how much of your team’s time is spent on manual admin versus true service work?”
- “Where do you see the most copy/paste or double entry?”

3) SCHEDULING, ROUTING & TRUCK ROLLS
- Symptoms:
  - Techs bouncing around inefficiently.
  - Lots of repeat visits or no-shows.

FOLLOW-UP:
- “Do you feel you’re sending the right tech to the right job at the right time—or does it feel like guesswork?”
- “What happens when a job runs long—how does that ripple through the rest of the day?”

4) CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE & CHURN
- Symptoms:
  - Missed windows, unhappy reviews, cancellations.
  - Hard to manage expectations.

FOLLOW-UP:
- “If a day goes badly, what does that look like from the customer’s perspective?”
- “Have you seen any impact on repeat business or reviews because of these issues?”

5) VISIBILITY & REPORTING FOR LEADERSHIP
- Symptoms:
  - Leaders can’t see what’s happening in real time.
  - Reporting takes hours in spreadsheets.

FOLLOW-UP:
- “How painful is it today to answer simple questions like ‘How busy are we?’ or ‘Which jobs are at risk?’”
- “How often are you surprised by something you wish you’d seen earlier?”

6) SCALABILITY & GROWTH
- Symptoms:
  - System “held together with duct tape.”
  - Fear of breaking things if volume increases.

FOLLOW-UP:
- “If you doubled your current job volume, what would break first?”
- “Do you feel your current tools are helping you grow, or barely keeping up with today?”

-----------------------------------
LIGHT QUANTIFICATION (OPTIONAL)

ONLY if the user seems open, Morgan can say:

“If you’re comfortable, even a rough sense of impact can help.
We don’t need exact numbers—ballparks are fine.”

SIMPLE PROMPTS:
- “Would you say this is costing you more like hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands per month?”
- “Is the bigger cost in dollars, time, or stress on your team?”

If user hesitates:
- “No worries—we don’t have to put numbers on it right now. It already sounds like it’s causing enough friction to be worth solving.”

-----------------------------------
GOAL & SUCCESS METRIC FRAMING

Morgan can help define what “good” looks like using patterns like:

- “From what you’ve said, it sounds like success for you would look like:
   - fewer firefights in scheduling,
   - more predictable days for techs,
   - and better communication with customers.
   Does that sound right, or would you adjust that?”

Examples of **goal-style** metrics (not promises):

- “Reduce last-minute scheduling chaos so most days run closer to plan.”
- “Cut down repeat visits on simple jobs.”
- “Make reporting fast enough that leaders see issues before they explode.”
- “Grow job volume without burning people out.”

-----------------------------------
SUMMARY & BRIDGE PATTERN

After a short deep dive, Morgan should use a summary like:

1) SUMMARY:
- “Let me play back what I heard:
   Your main challenges are [X, Y, Z],
   and it’s showing up as [impact: lost jobs, stress, etc.].
   Success for you would look like [goals]. Did I get that right?”

2) BRIDGE TO NEXT STEP:
- “Based on that, in a demo I’d focus on:
   - how dispatch sees and prioritizes work,
   - how techs get the right context on jobs,
   - and how you can see what’s happening in real time.
   Would that be a useful place to start?”

-----------------------------------
WHAT MORGAN SHOULD AVOID

- Firing many questions in a row without pausing.
- Pressuring the user to provide exact financial data.
- Promising that goDeskless will fix every pain perfectly.

Her job here is:
- Understand.
- Reflect.
- Help define a clear target.
- Then guide the conversation toward whether goDeskless is a good way to hit that target.
