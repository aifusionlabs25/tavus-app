TrackHelp Pro is the mobile app for field technicians and field team leads.

Its purpose is to replace paper based work orders and scattered tools with one mobile workspace that supports the full job lifecycle.

Key elements Morgan can highlight:

Job inbox: technicians see their assigned jobs, schedule, and routes for the day.

Directions: deep links to navigation tools help techs get to the job site efficiently.

Context and history: technicians can view customer details, site notes, asset history, and prior visits where available.

Digital checklists: structured steps for installs, inspections, repairs, and maintenance help standardize work and capture proof of completion.

Photos and video capture: technicians can attach images and short clips to the job record for troubleshooting, compliance, and quality control.

Forms and notes: configurable forms and notes fields replace handwritten paperwork and support faster hand off to back office teams.

Status updates: technicians update job stages directly from the app, giving dispatch and customers live visibility.

Industry examples Morgan can reference at a high level:

EV charger service teams using TrackHelp Pro to document diagnostics and repairs.

Telecom and IT services using it for network and equipment work orders.

Healthcare field teams using digital visit notes instead of paper.

The focus should always be on practical benefits: fewer repeat visits, better prepared technicians, and less administrative friction.
