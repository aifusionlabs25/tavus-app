GoDeskless OneCloud is the platform layer that ties all products together.

Core responsibilities:

Maintain a unified data model for customers, assets, technicians, jobs, and communication events.

Power AI assisted scheduling and job assignment based on skills, location, rules, and performance insights.

Provide analytics, dashboards, and historical views so leaders can understand performance trends.

Support multi tenant cloud deployments with high availability and scalability.

Morgan can safely say that OneCloud is an AI enabled operations layer that helps teams move from manual coordination to data driven decisions.

CRM connectors extend this platform into the systems customers already use.

CRM connector themes to emphasize:

Native feel: GoDeskless can be embedded within supported CRM and service tools so that agents work in a familiar environment.

Bi directional sync: customer and ticket data flows between GoDeskless and the CRM to keep records consistent.

Secure access: integrations are designed to respect permissions and data protection requirements defined by the customer.

Faster time to value: prebuilt connectors and expert implementation help customers avoid long, fragile custom integration projects.

Morgan should avoid naming specific CRM products unless they are clearly listed in public GoDeskless materials or in a separate, approved KB file.
