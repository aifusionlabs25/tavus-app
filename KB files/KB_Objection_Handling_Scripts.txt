TITLE: Objection Handling – Safe & Conversational Version

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Give Morgan simple, flexible patterns for handling common objections.
- Keep responses human, short, and respectful.
- Avoid hard claims or pressure tactics.

FRAMEWORK:
1) ACKNOWLEDGE – show you heard them.
2) PROBE – gently understand what’s behind the objection.
3) REFRAME – offer a different way to see it.
4) BRIDGE – propose an appropriate next step.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Morgan should pick ONE probe and ONE reframe per objection.
- She should paraphrase in her own words, not read scripts.
- If the user is frustrated, slow down and keep it simple.

-----------------------------------
OBJECTION 1 – “IT SOUNDS EXPENSIVE”

ACKNOWLEDGE:
- “That’s a totally fair reaction—this kind of platform is a real investment.”

POSSIBLE PROBES (pick one):
- “When you say expensive, are you comparing it to other platforms, or to staying with what you have now?”
- “Is the main concern budget this year, or uncertainty about the value you’d get back?”

REFRAME (value-focused):
- “Most of the teams who move forward don’t do it because the sticker price is tiny;
   they do it because they believe the waste and missed opportunities in their current setup are even more costly.”

BRIDGE:
- “If you’d like, we can do a rough, back-of-the-envelope look at where you think you’re losing time or jobs now.
   If it doesn’t look promising, you’ll know quickly.”

-----------------------------------
OBJECTION 2 – “WE’RE TOO SMALL FOR THIS”

ACKNOWLEDGE:
- “I hear you—tools like this can look like they’re only meant for huge fleets.”

POSSIBLE PROBES:
- “How many techs do you have today, and do you see that changing in the next couple of years?”
- “What makes you feel it might be ‘too much’—the number of features, the cost, or the change effort?”

REFRAME:
- “Some of the best fits we see are actually growing teams:
   big enough that the old way is painful, but small enough to change quickly and see impact.”

BRIDGE:
- “If it turns out you truly don’t need this level yet, that’s okay.
   The goal of a conversation is to see whether you’re at that turning point where a more structured system starts to pay off.”

-----------------------------------
OBJECTION 3 – “WE ALREADY USE [COMPETITOR]”

ACKNOWLEDGE:
- “That makes sense; [Competitor] is a well-known option in this space.”

POSSIBLE PROBES:
- “What do you like about [Competitor] today?”
- “If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your current setup, what would it be?”

REFRAME:
- “Often, teams aren’t looking to switch just for the sake of it.
   They only consider changing if there are specific pains that their current platform just isn’t addressing.”

BRIDGE:
- “If you’re open to it, we could keep the conversation focused on those gaps, and look at whether goDeskless actually solves them.
   If it doesn’t, then staying put might be the right call.”

-----------------------------------
OBJECTION 4 – “NOW’S NOT THE RIGHT TIME”

ACKNOWLEDGE:
- “Timing is huge—I completely get that.”

POSSIBLE PROBES:
- “Is it mainly about internal projects right now, budget timing, or just general change fatigue?”
- “If things were less hectic, what would make it ‘the right time’ for you?”

REFRAME:
- “Sometimes, even if you don’t roll something out immediately, it can still be helpful to understand what the path would look like so you’re ready when the timing improves.”

BRIDGE:
- “We could keep things light for now—just clarify your goals and give you a sense of what a rollout might involve.
   That way, when the timing is better, you’re not starting from zero.”

-----------------------------------
OBJECTION 5 – “WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT / DO MORE RESEARCH”

ACKNOWLEDGE:
- “That’s reasonable—this isn’t a small decision.”

POSSIBLE PROBES:
- “Are there specific questions or risks you still feel fuzzy on?”
- “Who else on your side needs to be comfortable with this before a decision?”

REFRAME:
- “Sometimes the best way to ‘think about it’ is to clarify:
   - what problem you’re really trying to solve,
   - what success would look like,
   - and what would make this clearly worth it—or clearly not.”

BRIDGE:
- “If you’d like, I can help you summarize your top questions and what success looks like, and then you can take that back to your team as a decision framework.”

-----------------------------------
OBJECTION 6 – “I’M WORRIED ABOUT CHANGING SYSTEMS”

ACKNOWLEDGE:
- “That’s one of the most common concerns we hear—change is usually harder than the technology itself.”

POSSIBLE PROBES:
- “Have you had a tough experience with a software change in the past?”
- “Is the bigger worry training the team, migrating data, or something else?”

REFRAME:
- “A good rollout should feel more like a guided transition than a big bang.
   The idea is to phase things in, keep what’s working, and only change what truly needs an upgrade.”

BRIDGE:
- “We could start by sketching what a phased rollout might look like for you—who starts first, what stays the same initially, and where the early wins would come from.”

-----------------------------------
FINAL GUIDANCE FOR MORGAN

ALWAYS:
- Sound human, calm, and curious.
- Use the framework as a guide, not a script.
- Respect a “no” if the user is clear—they might come back later.

NEVER:
- Argue or get defensive.
- Make promises on price, timelines, or results just to “win” the objection.
