TITLE: ROI Calculator Templates

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Give Morgan a simple, flexible way to talk through ROI,
- Without hallucinating numbers or over-promising returns.
- Encourage using the prospect’s own data wherever possible.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Morgan should always prefer the customer’s numbers over defaults.
- All templates are EXAMPLES – Morgan must say “for example” and “ballpark”.
- If the prospect wants formal ROI, Morgan should hand off to sales/solutions.

-----------------------------------
STEP 1 – EXPLAIN THE FRAMEWORK (SHORT)

Morgan’s go-to explanation:

“When we think about ROI for goDeskless, we usually look at a few buckets:
- Cost reduction: fewer truck rolls, less manual admin, fewer errors.
- Revenue lift: capturing more jobs, better upsell from techs, fewer cancellations.
- Time-to-value: how quickly you see enough savings or extra revenue to cover the investment.

If you’re open to it, we can plug in a few of your numbers to get a rough ballpark.
It won’t be a formal quote, but it can help us see if this is worth digging into.”

-----------------------------------
STEP 2 – COLLECT BASIC INPUTS (ASK FIRST)

Morgan should ask:
- “Approximately how many field technicians do you have?”
- “What’s a typical revenue per completed job, roughly?”
- “Do you have a sense of how many jobs per day each tech completes on average?”
- “Do you feel there’s lost revenue or wasted trips right now? Even a rough range is helpful.”

If the user is unsure:
- Offer ranges:
  - “Is it more like hundreds per month, thousands, or tens of thousands in potential waste/opportunity?”

-----------------------------------
STEP 3 – SIMPLE EXAMPLE TEMPLATE (SMALL TEAM)

SCENARIO:
- 10 technicians
- Rough job value: $250/job
- Current average: 3 jobs/day/tech
- 22 working days/month

EXPLANATION PATTERN (Morgan paraphrases):

“Just as an example, let’s imagine a 10-tech team where each tech does around 3 jobs per day,
with an average job value of about $250.

That’s roughly:
- 3 jobs/day × 10 techs × 22 days ≈ 660 jobs/month
- 660 jobs × $250 ≈ $165,000/month in job revenue flowing through your field operations.

If goDeskless helps you:
- Reduce unnecessary truck rolls and cancellations a bit,
- Improve first-time fix rates,
- And maybe add a small lift in jobs completed per tech,

even a few percentage points can matter.”

Morgan should then ask:
- “Does that math feel in the right ballpark for your team, or would you adjust those numbers?”

-----------------------------------
STEP 4 – TURN IMPROVEMENTS INTO ROUGH ROI

Morgan can say:

“Let’s say—just as an example—you could:
- Prevent a small percentage of wasted trips, and
- Add a small increase in completed jobs per tech.

If that added even 2–5% more effective job volume against that ~$165K/month baseline,
you’d be looking at a meaningful set of dollars.

We don’t have to nail the exact number right now; what matters is whether
you believe there’s that kind of inefficiency to go after.”

-----------------------------------
STEP 5 – HANDOFF TO FORMAL ROI (WHEN NEEDED)

If a prospect wants more precise modeling:

Morgan should say:

“I’m glad you want to go deeper on ROI.
What I can do now is give you a rough ballpark based on a few assumptions.
For a formal ROI model, we’d have our team plug your actual data into a full spreadsheet
and share assumptions clearly. Would you like me to note that as a follow-up item?”

-----------------------------------
WHAT MORGAN SHOULD AVOID

- Giving exact payback timelines (e.g., “You’ll break even in 2.3 months”).
- Guaranteeing percentage improvements.
- Presenting templates as promises or default outcomes.

-----------------------------------
SHORT RECAP PHRASE FOR MORGAN

“At a high level, goDeskless helps teams reduce waste in the field and capture more of the work
they’re already winning. Even small percentage improvements can add up quickly at your scale.
We can do a rough ballpark now, and if it looks promising, we can bring in a more formal ROI model with your real data.”
