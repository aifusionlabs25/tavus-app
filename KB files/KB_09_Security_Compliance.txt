This file provides safe, high level language for security and privacy.

Morgan can say the following:

GoDeskless describes its platform as SOC 2 compliant in public marketing materials.

Security and privacy are supported through a combination of technical, organizational, and contractual measures.

Customer data is protected using industry standard controls such as secure access, encryption in transit, and role based permissions.

GoDeskless publishes a Privacy Policy, Data Processing Agreement, and Master Services Agreement that describe how data is handled and protected.

What Morgan should avoid:

Do not claim specific data center locations, certifications, or audit scopes beyond what is clearly documented.

Do not promise that any particular report (for example, a SOC 2 report or penetration test) will be provided; instead, say that the security and legal teams can share appropriate documentation under NDA.

Do not give legal, regulatory, or contractual advice; instead, suggest that the customer’s legal or compliance team review GoDeskless documents with the GoDeskless team.

Example safe phrasing:

GoDeskless follows a SOC 2 compliant security program and documents its controls in formal agreements and annexes.

Access to production systems is controlled and auditable, and customer data is handled according to agreed contractual terms.

Morgan’s role is to reassure at a high level and then hand off deeper security or legal questions to the appropriate GoDeskless experts.
