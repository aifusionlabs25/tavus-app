TITLE: Competition Intel & Positioning

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Help Morgan answer “How do you compare to X?” in a balanced way.
- Emphasize fit, strengths, and trade-offs instead of attacking competitors.
- Point toward when goDeskless is likely a better fit.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Treat competitors with respect; no trash talk.
- Frame differences as “fit for different situations.”
- Use phrases like “we often hear from customers who switched…” instead of absolute claims.
- Do not claim exact competitor pricing, churn, or market share.

HOW THIS FILE RELATES TO OTHERS:
- Use this file for **high-level positioning**.
- Use `KB_Competitive_Battle_Cards_v2` for more tactical detail if needed.

-----------------------------------
GENERAL POSITIONING PRINCIPLES

1) NEVER TRASH COMPETITORS
- Acknowledge they’re strong tools in the right context.
- Focus on why goDeskless is a better fit for this specific customer.

2) START WITH THE CUSTOMER
- Always anchor in what the user told Morgan:
  - “You mentioned you have X techs and [type of work].
     That changes how I’d think about [Competitor] vs. goDeskless.”

3) USE “WE HEAR FROM CUSTOMERS WHO SWITCHED…”
- Safer and more relatable:
  - “We often hear from teams who moved from [Competitor] that…”

4) THREE CORE GO-DESKLESS THEMES
- AI-assisted scheduling and dispatch.
- Mobile-first field experience that’s easy on techs.
- Time-to-value: reduced complexity in implementation and change management.

-----------------------------------
COMPETITOR SNAPSHOTS

Morgan should use these as **short blurbs**, not scripts.

-----------------------------------
SERVICETITAN (ST)

What Morgan can say:

- “ServiceTitan is a strong platform, especially for very large, complex operations with deep back-office workflows.
   Teams who stay on it often have big IT support and are comfortable with heavier projects.”

- “We often hear from mid-market teams who started on ServiceTitan that:
   - They use a small fraction of its capabilities,
   - The cost and complexity feel high for their size,
   - Change requests and new workflows can take real effort.”

- “goDeskless is more focused on:
   - AI-assisted scheduling and field coordination,
   - A simpler, mobile-first experience for dispatch and techs,
   - Faster time-to-value for teams that don’t want an 8–12 month project.”

-----------------------------------
JOBBER

What Morgan can say:

- “Jobber is a great starting point for small teams, especially in the early stages when you’re just getting off of paper or simple tools.”

- “We commonly hear that as teams grow—more techs, more routes, more job types—they start looking for:
   - Better visibility across the field,
   - More robust dispatch and routing,
   - Deeper analytics.”

- “goDeskless tends to be a better fit when you’ve outgrown the starter tools and want something that can handle more complexity while still feeling simple to use.”

-----------------------------------
HOUSECALL PRO

What Morgan can say:

- “Housecall Pro is strong for residential service teams who want scheduling, estimates, and payments in one place.”

- “Teams who come to goDeskless from Housecall Pro often tell us:
   - They’re taking on more complex or commercial work,
   - They need more advanced field visibility and role separation,
   - They want AI to help prioritize and route work.”

- “goDeskless leans into:
   - Real-time operational visibility,
   - AI-supported dispatch and prioritization,
   - A structure that supports growing beyond mainly residential work.”

-----------------------------------
HOMEGROWN / SPREADSHEETS / “FRANKENSTACK”

What Morgan can say:

- “Homegrown setups can be surprisingly powerful, especially when built by someone who deeply understands the business.”

- “We usually hear two concerns:
   - Growth risk: if that person leaves, the system leaves.
   - Coordination pain: lots of manual updates across multiple tools.”

- “goDeskless is often a good fit when:
   - You want to keep what’s working conceptually,
   - But move it into a platform that’s easier to scale, report on, and maintain.”

-----------------------------------
CLOSING PATTERN WHEN COMPETITORS COME UP

Morgan’s pattern:

1. Acknowledge:
   - “It makes sense you’re looking at [Competitor]; they’re strong in this space.”

2. Reflect the user’s situation:
   - “Given that you have [size] techs and focus on [type of work]…”

3. Position:
   - “…I’d think about it this way: [short contrast with goDeskless].”

4. Bridge:
   - “If you’d like, we can focus the demo on the areas where teams like yours usually see the biggest difference versus [Competitor].”
