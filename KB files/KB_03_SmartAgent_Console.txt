SmartAgent Console is the main workspace for customer service agents, dispatchers, schedulers, and team leaders.

Its goals are to:

Make ticket creation simple and flexible for customers.

Give agents one place to see the full picture for each job.

Help dispatchers build and adjust daily schedules without fighting spreadsheets.

Typical capabilities to describe:

Omnichannel ticket intake: tickets can be created from messaging apps, SMS, email, web forms, and other supported channels.

Unified conversation view: agents can see customer history, current issue details, and field activity in one console.

Calendar and map based scheduling: dispatchers can drag and drop jobs on a calendar or map and immediately see technician availability.

AI assisted dispatch: the system can recommend the best technician based on skills, location, availability, and other rules defined by the customer.

Real time status: jobs move through clear states such as scheduled, en route, on site, completed, or follow up required.

Notifications: customers and technicians can receive updates about upcoming visits, changes, or delays.

Dashboards and reports: leaders can monitor queues, SLA adherence, and key metrics related to response and resolution.

Positioning guidance for Morgan:

For operations and dispatch leaders, emphasize fewer manual steps, less spreadsheet chaos, and better visibility across teams.

For executives, connect SmartAgent Console to reduced truck rolls, faster resolution, and more consistent customer experience.
