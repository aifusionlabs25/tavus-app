TITLE: Industry-Specific Pain Points

PRIMARY USER: Morgan – X Agent guide for goDeskless-related conversations

PURPOSE:
- Help Morgan quickly recognize patterns by industry.
- Ask 1–2 sharp discovery questions, not a long survey.
- Tie pains to goDeskless capabilities in a natural, conversational way.

GLOBAL GUARDRAILS:
- Morgan should pick the most relevant 2–3 pain points and 1–2 questions.
- Do NOT read lists verbatim.
- Treat all examples as patterns, not assumptions—always validate with the user.

HOW MORGAN SHOULD USE THIS FILE:
1. Listen for industry cues (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, property management, general home services).
2. Reflect back what she heard: “Sounds like you’re running an HVAC team with busy summers…”
3. Choose 1–2 pain points that obviously match what the user said.
4. Ask 1 follow-up question to deepen understanding.
5. Offer 1–2 high-level ways goDeskless could help.

-----------------------------------
SECTION 1 – HVAC CONTRACTORS

TYPICAL PROFILE:
- Seasonal spikes (summer/winter).
- Mix of emergency calls and planned maintenance.
- Trucks and techs stretched thin in peak months.

COMMON PAIN PATTERNS:
- Seasonal overload: dispatchers overwhelmed, harder to prioritize.
- Balancing emergencies vs. maintenance contracts.
- Missed or delayed jobs during peak heat waves.
- Limited visibility into where techs actually are.

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (pick 1–2):
- “How do you handle the summer surge—do you feel on top of it or mostly in firefighting mode?”
- “How do you decide which tech gets which job during peak season?”
- “Do you have maintenance contracts that sometimes slip because emergencies always win?”
- “If you had to guess, where do you lose the most time—dispatch, drive time, or job coordination?”

GODESKLESS HOOKS (paraphrase, don’t read):
- AI-assisted scheduling and routing to prioritize high-impact jobs.
- Real-time tech location and job status for better dispatch decisions.
- Maintenance contract tracking so they don’t get buried by emergencies.
- Simple field app so techs capture notes, photos, and follow-ups consistently.

-----------------------------------
SECTION 2 – PLUMBING COMPANIES

TYPICAL PROFILE:
- Emergency-heavy: burst pipes, leaks, sewer backups.
- Job duration often unpredictable.
- Reliant on parts availability and quick decisions.

COMMON PAIN PATTERNS:
- Emergencies blow up the schedule and push other jobs out.
- “Simple” jobs turning into all-day projects.
- Multiple supply house trips per day.
- Hard to track warranties and callbacks.

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (pick 1–2):
- “When emergencies hit, how do you decide what to bump and who to send?”
- “How often does a ‘quick’ job turn into a half-day project, and what happens to the schedule when it does?”
- “How do you keep track of warranty or callback work so you’re not doing free labor by accident?”
- “Do your techs ever feel like they’re living at the supply house?”

GODESKLESS HOOKS (paraphrase):
- Dynamic scheduling that can reshuffle jobs when durations change.
- Tagging emergency vs. non-emergency work and protecting high-value commitments.
- Better job notes and history so callbacks are visible and trackable.
- Visibility into parts-related delays to help plan smarter.

-----------------------------------
SECTION 3 – ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS

TYPICAL PROFILE:
- Mix of quick service calls and multi-day projects.
- Frequent permits and inspections.
- Safety and compliance are major concerns.

COMMON PAIN PATTERNS:
- Keeping track of permit status and inspection dates.
- Coordinating multi-day jobs and handoffs between techs.
- Ensuring the right level of licensed tech is on each job.
- Documenting code compliance and safety steps.

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (pick 1–2):
- “How do you currently track permits and inspections—spreadsheets, paper, or a system?”
- “For multi-day projects, how do you keep everyone aligned on status across shifts?”
- “Do you ever worry about the wrong tech being scheduled on a job that needs a specific license?”
- “How comfortable do you feel if an inspector asked for documentation on a job from six months ago?”

GODESKLESS HOOKS (paraphrase):
- Tracking permits and inspections with reminders.
- Multi-day job visibility with progress notes and milestones.
- Role-based dispatch rules so only appropriately licensed techs are assigned certain jobs.
- Digital job documentation and checklists that support compliance and audits.

-----------------------------------
SECTION 4 – PROPERTY MANAGEMENT / FACILITIES

TYPICAL PROFILE:
- Portfolio of properties or facilities.
- Mix of resident requests, preventative maintenance, and vendor coordination.
- Multiple stakeholders: internal teams, residents/tenants, vendors.

COMMON PAIN PATTERNS:
- Requests slipping through cracks or delayed communication.
- Low visibility into which work orders are truly urgent.
- Difficulty coordinating internal teams and external vendors.
- Hard to report on SLA compliance and response times.

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (pick 1–2):
- “How do maintenance requests come in today—phone, email, portal, all of the above?”
- “What’s hardest right now: prioritizing work, actually getting it done, or reporting back to owners/leadership?”
- “Do you ever get surprised by missed SLAs or unhappy tenants because something got stuck?”
- “How many different systems do you touch just to track ‘one’ work order?”

GODESKLESS HOOKS (paraphrase):
- Centralized intake for maintenance requests with clear status.
- Priority rules and SLAs surfaced to dispatchers.
- Visibility for property managers into what’s open, in progress, and closed.
- Mobile tools for techs and vendors so updates happen in real time.

-----------------------------------
SECTION 5 – GENERAL HOME SERVICES & “OTHER”

TYPICAL PROFILE:
- Mix of home services (appliance repair, landscaping, pest control, etc.).
- Small-to-mid teams often growing from “owner plus a couple of techs.”

COMMON PAIN PATTERNS:
- Owner/dispatcher wearing too many hats.
- Lack of visibility into schedule adherence and job outcomes.
- Inconsistent customer communication and follow-up.
- Hard to scale without losing control.

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (pick 1–2):
- “What does a typical day look like for whoever handles scheduling and dispatch?”
- “Do you feel you have a clear picture of who’s where and what’s actually done at any moment?”
- “How do you stay on top of follow-ups or recurring work so nothing falls through the cracks?”
- “If you doubled your job volume, what would break first?”

GODESKLESS HOOKS (paraphrase):
- Central schedule and real-time map of jobs/techs.
- Simple field app that standardizes how jobs are documented.
- Automated reminders for follow-ups and recurring work.
- A platform that helps the owner/dispatcher get out of pure firefighting.
